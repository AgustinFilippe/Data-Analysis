# Data Analysis Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! My name is Agustin Filippe, and I am a computer engineering student with a passion for Data and Artificial Intelligence. My academic and personal projects are driven by my interest in statistics, algebra, and the transformative power of data. This repository is designed to be a living document, showcasing my journey and growth in the field of data analysis.

## About This Repository
This repository is currently in the early stages of development. It is intended to become a comprehensive showcase of my skills in data analysis, including projects that utilize tools such as PostgreSQL, Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and Python. As I continue to learn and grow as a data analyst, I will update this repository with new projects that reflect my latest skills and insights.

## Upcoming Projects
While specific projects are not yet listed, the following are areas I am interested in exploring and plan to develop projects around:
- Data visualization and storytelling with Power BI and Tableau.
- Predictive modeling using Python and statistical analysis techniques.
- Database management and data manipulation with PostgreSQL.
- Advanced analytics projects leveraging machine learning algorithms.

## Skills and Tools
- **Programming Languages**: R for statistc analysis, Python for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Database Management**: Proficient in SQL with PostgreSQL and SQLServer.
- **Data Visualization**: Experienced in creating interactive dashboards with Power BI, PL-300 Certificate included.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Strong foundation in statistical concepts and applications in data analysis.

## How to Navigate This Repository
As projects are added, each will be contained within its own directory along with a `README.md` file detailing the project's overview, objectives, key findings, and instructions for replication.

## Contributing
I am currently focusing on building out this portfolio with personal projects. However, I am open to collaboration in the future. Feel free to reach out if you have ideas or projects in mind that we could collaborate on.
